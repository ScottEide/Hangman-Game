# Hangman

### Installation

If you only want to run and use the software, click on the "Hangman.exe" file above and then download it.  
  
Once it is done downloading, open the file and you'll be all set. The window for the software can take a few seconds to pop up, so please be patient if it isn't instantaneous.  
  
  
  
If you would like to edit or review the code in a development environment, you will need to have Visual Studio.
Visual Studio can be downloaded here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16
  
Once it is done downloading, open the file. 

It will do an initial setup for Visual Studio then it will ask you what workloads to install. 

Select ".NET desktop development" and "Universal Windows Platform development", then click install. 
  
After it's done installing, select whatever preferences you want. 
  
You will now need to download the files for the Hangman project. 
  
On the current page above the files, click on the green "Clone or download" button. THen click download as zip.
 
Once it is finished downloading, extract all the contents to an empty folder on your computer.
 
Now simply double click the "Hangman.sln" file.  Visual Studio will then load the project up for you.
  
Have fun and thank you for checking out my software!
